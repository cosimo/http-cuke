=head1 NAME

http-cuke - Cucumber-style HTTP testing for the masses

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Example of test scenario:

    Feature: Front page responds correctly
    In order to avoid problems with caching logic and/or frontend configuration
    As an operations ninja
    I want to check that front page is served correctly and the frontends configuration is correct

    Scenario: HTTP to HTTPS redirects are in place
      When I go to "http://my.example.server.lan/"
      Then I should be redirected to "https://my.example.server.lan/"
      Then the final HTTP status code should be "200"

Put that text in a C<whatever.test> file, and point
C<http-cuke> to the directory that contains it with:

    http-cuke --test-dir ./some-tests

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Run cucumber style tests against any HTTP server.

If you are not familiar with cucumber, check it out
at L<http://cukes.info/>.

With this tool you can define set of tests (or B<features>
and B<scenarios> in cucumber-speak) and run them.

Within each test you can check redirects, response bodies,
inject custom HTTP headers, check Varnish responses, and more.

=head1 MOTIVATION

B<Why did I write this?>

This tool is not meant to replace tools like C<WWW::Mechanize>
or similar ones. It is meant to perform automated testing
for frontends configuration testing.

By frontend I mean Apache, Nginx, Varnish, and deadly
combinations of the three. It can be a nightmare to make
sure you have all the correct redirects in place, that
pages are cached according to your own logic, etc...

Yes, but even then, after all, cucumber is pretty well established.
So why?

Because of the dependencies mess. I don't want to depend
on too many packages, and Perl already has all the tools
we need to do this.

You just glue them together, and you have a TAP-compliant
cucumber-style HTTP testing.

The B<main advantage of this tool> is that it opens up even
complex HTTP testing to a broader audience, not necessarily
programmers. That is, btw, the whole point of BDD testing,
and that's B<GOOD>.

=head1 AVAILABLE TESTS

So what are the B<magic words> that are available to build
the test cases?

Here's a list:

=over 4

=item C<Given a max of (\d+) redirects>

=item C<Given a timeout of (\d+) seconds>

=item C<Given a "(.+)" user agent>

=item C<Given the HTTP request header "(.+)" is "(.*)">

=item C<When I go to "(.+)">

=item C<Then the page should be cached>

=item C<Then the page should not be cached>

=item C<Then I should be redirected to "(.+)">

=item C<Then the HTTP status code should be "(.+)">

=item C<Then the HTTP status line should match "(.+)">

=item C<Then the page shouldn't contain "(.+)">

=item C<Then the page should contain "(.+)">
