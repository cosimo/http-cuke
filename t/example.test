Feature: Google front page allows me to search
In order to be stuck without being able to google something
As an curious person
I want to be able to search stuff online

Scenario: Google frontpage is available
  Given the HTTP request header "Accept-Language" is "en"
  When I go to "http://www.google.com/"
  Then the final HTTP status code should be "200"
  Then the page should contain "Google"
